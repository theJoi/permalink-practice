<p>Here is the technique I use: Capture one set of frames from ground to sky (bottom to top), stay in that spot and turn clo ckwise just one increment; now capture each frame top to bottom, turn clockwise another increment; now go bottom to top, then turn another increment, top to bottom, and so on. Keep doing this until you have covered the entire area, or as much of it as you want to use. Again, all pictures must overlap slightly, and in my experience it takes about 50 shots to get full coverage.</p>
