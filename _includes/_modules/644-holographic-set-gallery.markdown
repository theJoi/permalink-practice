<h1 class="sports-blue">Holographic Virtual Sets</h1>
<br />Virtual Sets are best when you need your on-screen talent to appear in a studio environment. But if you want to transport your stars on location to any site in the world--or even out of this world--you can, with Holographic virtual sets. These are 360-degree virtual environments that can be created from your own 3D models, or with panoramic images snapped with a smartphone or camera, when you use <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=773&amp;Itemid=467">Virtual Set Editor (VSE)</a> 2.5. We've included a few samples in TriCaster pro line models so you can experiment hands-on with taking your vision to the next dimension.
