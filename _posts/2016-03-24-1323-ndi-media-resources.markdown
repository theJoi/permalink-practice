<p><strong>100 Word Description</strong> – NDI, NewTek’s innovative Network Device Interface technology, is an open protocol enabling IP video workflows across standard GigE networks. NDI is a bi-directional standard that allows video systems to identify and communicate with one another over IP, and to encode, transmit, and receive multiple streams of broadcast-quality, low latency, frame-accurate video and audio in real time. The NDI encoding algorithm supports all video resolutions and frame rates up to 4K and beyond, as well as multi-channel, floating-point audio up to 16 channels and beyond. NDI also includes tools to implement video access and grouping, bi-directional metadata, tally, and more.</p>
